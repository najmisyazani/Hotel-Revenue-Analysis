## Technical Summary:
-	Created a comprehensive SQL database containing `100,732 data points` on hotel booking history to identify patterns and derive actionable insights for business strategies.
-	Imported the dataset into Tableau to develop an interactive dashboard showcasing key performance metrics, including total revenue, average daily rate (ADR), total nights booked, and car parking space usage.
-	Identified a significant increase in total revenue from $1.23M in 2018 to $5.49M in 2019, marking a `347% growth`. However, there was a subsequent `decline of 20%` to $4.90M in 2020.
-	Observed that a small `increase in the average discount rate by 1.43%` positively impacted the total number of bookings, suggesting strategic discounting can drive higher occupancy rates.
-	Analyzed car parking trends, revealing that the current parking lot size is sufficient, as there is no immediate need for expansion based on usage patterns.
